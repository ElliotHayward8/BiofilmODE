For the parameter scan should I be looking for lowest total treatment time or the lowest total time

Check submission to HPC

Check graph of treatment time vs T1T2

Check the equation for a and b then can create all the graphs

through the rest of the project

Do I need to explain what TA pair is - if so from papers I still don't really understand

Only 8 pages what do you think I could cut out
