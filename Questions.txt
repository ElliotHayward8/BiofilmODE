For the parameter scan should I be looking for lowest total treatment time or the lowest total time

Check submission to HPC

Check graph of treatment time vs T1T2

Check the equation for a and b then can create all the graphs

Check assumptions and the reasoning for each assumption - what assumptions will we try to alleviate through further work
through the rest of the project
