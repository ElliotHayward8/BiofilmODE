Plot the 3D graph

Do the search including higher values to check if they are used, if they arent then this can be stated with a figure in
the final report - in Interim just state they werent used becuase of this (speed it up)


Evaluating with the NetLogo model as we can see when the ODE models are still viable and can be used as they are less
computationally expensive

Plot total Y-axis: treatment time against both on x-axis T_treat and T_recover (two separate lines, show how as
total treatment times increase others typically increase)

USE HPC - tutorial on website
CSV returning total treatment time (remove original growth time), optimal T1, optimal T2 and the a and b values

Use GraphMaker.py to plot the graph comparison for a and b being 1 and 0.1 - need to add plotting and run then sort out
